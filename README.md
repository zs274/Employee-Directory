# Employee Directory

A React App that allows the user to view an employee directory, and sort and filter it. 

## Pseudo Code
1. Create React app
2. Create components to handle each part of the app
3. Create link to API and context
4. Build and deploy app

Based on this my code would have to:
- Use components to build out a table that displays employee data
- This data has to come from the Random User API
- Sort and filter the categories by one property

## Difficulties
Although React seems straighforward it's a bit difficult to get used to how it all works. I think with further study and practice it will be easier and quicker to develop apps.

## Overall thoughts
This was a difficult assignment but reading the React documentation helped a lot.

## Links
You can view the deployed app [here](https://zs274.github.io/Employee-Directory/)
